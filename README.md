# hello-world
hello-world its me. I just called to say I love you. I said I loved you but I lied. These are my confessions if I'm going to tell it then I'm going to tell it all.
If I think a thought and then view that thought am I thinking about the thought that thought that thought or am I viewing the thought that thought to think about viewing the thought of thinking about a thought. - Angus Baumgardt
